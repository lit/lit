        When I register an event listener on a button like this:

        ```html
        <button @click=${this._onClickButton}>Click me</button>
        ```

        I would expect the `_onClickButton` event handler to fire when the button is clicked.

        However, clicking on the button doesn't fire the event handler, and I see the following error in the console:

        ```
        repro.js:23 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'numClicks')
        at XRepro._onClickButton (repro.js:23:24)
        at EventPart.handleEvent (lit-html.js:1383:35)
        ```
