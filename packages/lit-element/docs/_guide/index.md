## What is LitElement?

LitElement is a simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components that work in any web page with any framework.

LitElement uses [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) to render into shadow DOM, and adds API to manage properties and attributes. Properties are observed by default, and elements update asynchronously when their properties change.
