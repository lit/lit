There are many great resources and locations to learn about LitElement and web components,
share what you've built, and more. All community participation is subject to the Polymer Project's
<a href="https://github.com/Polymer/project/blob/master/Code_of_Conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a>—be
excellent to each other!

*   <strong>Join us on <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/slack-invite">Slack</a>!</strong> The
    Polymer Project Slack workspace has thousands of users discussing LitElement, web components, and related topics.
    Check out <code>#general</code>, <code>#beginners</code>, or
    <code>#tools</code> to get started. 
    
*   Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/polymer">Twitter</a>
    for the latest on web components and the Polymer Project. Many
    of our team members can be found tweeting about LitElement, lit-html, 
    and the latest developments in the web platform.

*   The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/polymer-dev">polymer-dev</a>
    mailing list is great for long-form questions and discussion on any of the libraries, polyfills, or 
    standards the the Polymer Project works on.

*   On <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/lit-element">StackOverflow</a> use
    the <code><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/lit-element">lit-element</a></code> or 
    <code><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/lit-html">lit-html</a></code> tags when
    looking for answers. You can also find help on underlying web standards like 
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/web-component">web components</a>, and try your
    hand at answering other people’s queries.
