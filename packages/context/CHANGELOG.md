### Minor Changes

- [#4371](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4371) [`62df19da`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/62df19da63b94b89e688277967b84b381dcf1660) Thanks [@autopulated](https://github.com/autopulated)! - `ContextProvider` can now be added to any HTML elements, not just custom elements implementing a `ReactiveControllerHost`.

### Patch Changes

- [#4373](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4373) [`22919f6d`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/22919f6d0051f075bdb5f6033a5e4263b76a0c3e) - Make property decorated with `@provide()` with TypeScript experimental decorators configurable.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#4329](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4329) [`df1980fe`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/df1980feaba3171be078ffce4b3c8c538758c599) - Remove dependency on `lit` package. All implementation code only uses `@lit/reactive-element`. `lit` is moved to dev dependencies as it is still used for tests.

- [#4286](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4286) [`1fb7a108`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/1fb7a108ef4d247517da31551fe34a91d3c6f8e7) - Fix erroneous description for the JSDoc on the `@provide()` decorator.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#4210](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4210) [`cf7d96d4`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/cf7d96d48c7a7d1f18d82b999a31f7d62d10d7b3) - Graduate @lit-labs/context to @lit/context, its permanent location. @lit-labs/context is now just a proxy for @lit/context, so code need not be duplicated in projects that depend on both.
