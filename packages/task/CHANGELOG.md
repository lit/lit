# Change Log

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#4552](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4552) [`4050cac6`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/4050cac64e39870eb0257d2ab8f72f3e43b92077) Thanks [@jrencz](https://github.com/jrencz)! - Make `status` of Task a readonly property

  So far `status` was writable which allowed for setting status of task form outside. Doing so did cause rendering of
  expected template but the task was becoming internally incoherent.

  Now attempt to assign `status` will end up in throwing a `TypeError`.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#4170](https://github.com/lit/lit/pull/4170) [`04c8d65a`](https://github.com/lit/lit/commit/04c8d65ad8dd82c239fc04c478e36eed4d8694c4) - Graduate @lit-labs/task to @lit/task, its permanent location. @lit-labs/task is now just a proxy for @lit/task, so code need not be duplicated in projects that depend on both.
